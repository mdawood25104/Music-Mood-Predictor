# 🎧 MUSIC MOOD PREDICTOR

The Music Mood Predictor utilizes a Random Forest algorithm to provide personalized music recommendations based on user-input audio features. With its user-friendly Streamlit interface, the application offers an interactive experience, allowing users to explore mood-specific song suggestions seamlessly. Continuous improvement is ensured through a feedback loop, adapting the model to better cater to individual preferences over time.

## Working of the Project

The **Music Mood Predictor** is an interactive system designed to recommend music based on the user's mood. Unlike traditional recommendation systems, our approach allows users to input specific audio features of a song, enabling a personalized and precise mood prediction.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

1. **Dataset:** We gathered a diverse dataset of music tracks, each labeled with corresponding mood categories (e.g., happy, sad, energetic).

2. **Features Extraction:** Extracted relevant audio features from the dataset, including tempo, key, valence, danceability, and acousticness, to capture the musical characteristics associated with different moods.

### Machine Learning Model

3. **Model Training:** Utilized a Random Forest machine learning model to predict the mood of a given music track based on its audio features.

4. **User Input:** Unlike traditional systems, our model accepts user input for specific audio features, allowing for a personalized mood prediction experience.

### User Interaction

5. **Streamlit Interface:** Developed a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, enabling users to input the audio features of a song or select from predefined moods.

6. **Mood Prediction:** The application processes user-input audio features and uses the Random Forest model to predict the mood of the provided song.

### Visualizations

7. **Output Display:** Visualized the predicted mood along with relevant information such as artist, song title, and mood tags.

8. **Interactive UI:** Designed an interactive user interface that allows users to input audio features, receive mood predictions, and explore recommended tracks directly within the application.

### Continuous Learning

9. **Feedback Loop:** Incorporated user feedback mechanisms to continuously improve the Random Forest model, enhancing the accuracy of mood predictions for a more personalized experience.

This project aims to revolutionize music recommendations by providing users with the ability to input specific audio features, ensuring a tailored and accurate mood prediction for each song.
